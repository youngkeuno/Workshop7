# Workshop7
I wrote a function that reads through a text file and looks for the word “yellow.” It prints out “Found Yellow” if it finds the word “yellow.” I then wrote a function that takes in a file and the word to search for as input. It then says whether that word is in the file or not. I tested my function on a text file of William Shakespeare plays to look for the word “ophelia.” I then made the same function but added the stipulation that it must say how many times that word is found in the text file. I tested the function on the Shakespeare text files to count how many times “death” appears.
